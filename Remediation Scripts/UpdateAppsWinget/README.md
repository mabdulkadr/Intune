## Overview

This repository contains PowerShell scripts to **detect** and **update** a set of essential software applications within an organization. Leveraging the Windows Package Manager (`winget.exe`), these scripts ensure that critical applications remain up-to-date, enhancing security and performance with minimal manual effort.

## Features

- **Automated Detection:** Identify installed software and check for available updates.
- **Automated Remediation:** Update outdated software to the latest versions seamlessly.
- **Multi-Application Support:** Manage applications like 7-Zip, WinRAR, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Zoom, Notepad++, Company Portal, and VLC.
- **Scalable:** Easily extendable to include additional applications.
- **Logging & Error Handling:** Provides feedback on update statuses and handles errors gracefully.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 (version 1809 or later) or Windows 11.
- **Winget:** Ensure Winget is installed (typically included with the App Installer from the Microsoft Store).
- **Permissions:** Administrative privileges to install or update software.
- **PowerShell Execution Policy:** Set to allow script execution:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```
- **Internet Connectivity:** Required for downloading updates via Winget.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/software-update-scripts.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd software-update-scripts
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Detection Script

**Filename:** `Detect-SoftwareUpdates.ps1`

**Purpose:**  
Checks installed applications and identifies those that need updates.

**Run the Script:**
```powershell
.\Detect-SoftwareUpdates.ps1
```

**Exit Codes:**
- `0`: All applications are up-to-date.
- `1`: Updates are available for one or more applications.

### 2. Remediation Script

**Filename:** `Remediate-SoftwareUpdates.ps1`

**Purpose:**  
Updates the specified applications to their latest versions.

**Run the Script:**
```powershell
.\Remediate-SoftwareUpdates.ps1
```

## Scheduling

Automate script execution using **Task Scheduler**:

1. **Open Task Scheduler** (`taskschd.msc`).
2. **Create a New Task** with appropriate triggers (e.g., daily at 2 AM).
3. **Set Actions** to run PowerShell with the desired script:
   ```powershell
   -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\Script\Detect-SoftwareUpdates.ps1"
   ```
4. **Configure Security Options** to run with highest privileges.

## Customization

### Adding More Applications

1. **Edit the `$apps` Array** in both scripts:
   ```powershell
   $apps = @(
       @{ ID = "7zip.7zip"; FriendlyName = "7-Zip" },
       # ... existing apps ...
       @{ ID = "YourApp.ID"; FriendlyName = "Your App Name" } # New app
   )
   ```
2. **Verify Winget IDs:**
   ```powershell
   winget search "Application Name"
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **winget.exe Not Found:** Ensure Winget is installed via the Microsoft Store.
- **Insufficient Permissions:** Run PowerShell as an Administrator.
- **Execution Policy Restrictions:** Adjust using `Set-ExecutionPolicy`.
- **Application Not Updating:** Verify Winget ID and check for specific update requirements.
