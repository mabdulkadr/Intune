
# Automate Windows Driver Update Approvals in Microsoft Intune

This PowerShell script automates the process of fetching Windows driver updates that require review and approving them for deployment in Microsoft Intune using Microsoft Graph API.


## Overview

Managing driver updates in an enterprise environment can be time-consuming. This script simplifies the process by:

- Installing necessary Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules.
- Authenticating to Microsoft Graph using a user account (supports MFA).
- Fetching Windows driver updates that are pending review.
- Automatically approving these driver updates for deployment in Microsoft Intune.
- Handling pagination and ensuring all applicable drivers are processed.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later.
- **PowerShell Version:** 5.1 or higher (PowerShell Core is also supported).
- **Microsoft .NET Framework:** 4.7.2 or later.
- **Network Access:** Internet connectivity to access the PowerShell Gallery and Microsoft Graph API.
- **Azure AD Account:** An account with the necessary permissions to manage Intune driver updates.

2. **Authentication Prompt:**

   - A sign-in window will appear.
   - Log in with your Azure AD account that has the necessary permissions.
   - Complete any MFA prompts if required.

3. **Script Execution:**

   - The script will install any missing modules.
   - It will connect to Microsoft Graph.
   - Fetch driver updates needing review.
   - Approve the drivers for deployment.
   - Disconnect from Microsoft Graph upon completion.

4. **Monitoring Progress:**
